1. MovingAverage.cpp: Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.
Solution: My first thought is to use a queue to store the elements, while it is hard to iterate the queue. So I switch to use list!!!! This
is really an useful and powerful data structure. list has a lot of functions to use, like pop_front(), pop_back(), push_front(), push_back().
I indeed should learn it as early as possible, in that way, my fb will not fail...
